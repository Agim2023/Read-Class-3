### HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

 #### 1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
 
 ~When marking up content which could be defined in some way as a list, you should consider using an unordered list ( <ul> ) for presentation.
  
#### 2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
  
  ~list-style-type : Sets the type of bullets to use for the list, for example, square or circle bullets for an unordered list, or numbers, letters, or roman numerals for an ordered list.
  
#### 3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
  
  ~Unordered lists are used when the order of the items is not relevant. List items in unordered lists are marked with a bullet. Ordered lists are used for sequential information and are automatically enumerated by the browser.
  
#### 4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
  
  ~ attribute allows us to change the style of numbers in an ordered list.
  
  ~ The value attribute changes the number of a specific list item and those that follow it.
  
#### 1. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
  
 ~Padding stars as: "Padman" in which represents the amount of inner space an element has.
  
  ~Margin stars as: "Max the Margin" which is whitespace available surrounding an element.
  
  ~their role in a story titled: "The Box Model" is to keeo your context within the body of your page.
  
#### 2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
  
  ~Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear

   ~Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
  
   ~Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
  
   ~Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

#### 1.What data types can you store inside of an Array?
 
   ~numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects.
 
 #### 2.Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
 
   ~Yes the people array is valid in JavaScript because it's still an object. You array is accessed by referring to the index number of the item in square brackets.
 
 #### 3.List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
 
   ~Arithmetic Operators
 
    Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.
 
   ~Assignment Operators
 
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.
 
   ~Comparison Operators
 
    Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
 
   ~Logical Operators
 
    Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
 
   ~Conditional Operators
 
    The conditional operator assigns a value to a variable based on a condition.
 
   ~Type Operators
 
    The type operator returns the type of a variable, object, function or expression.
 
 #### 4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
 
    ~let a = 10;
     let b = 'dog';
     let c = false;

     // evaluate this
     (a + c) + b;
 
    This result will be False because the last expession does not equal or express to the other variable above.
 
 #### 5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program
 
     ~If Statement Example

       (10 > 5) is the condition to test, which in this case is true — 10 is greater than 5. The part contained inside curly braces {} is the block of code to run.             Because the condition passes, the variable outcome is assigned the value "if block".
